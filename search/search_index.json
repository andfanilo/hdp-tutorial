Setup the environment Before working on the tutorial, we need a working Hadoop cluster. We are going to use: VirtualBox to run the virtual machine. HDP 2.5.0 . It is less demanding in terms of resources than version 3+ and sufficient for this tutorial. Follow the given steps to import the machine in VirtualBox: Download Hortonworks Sandbox 2.5.0 and unzip the appliance for VirtualBox. Import the .ova file into VirtualBox. Don't start it yet if you want to configure it. You may configure the VM to use more or less RAM depending on your machine, through the Configuration > System view. The recommended value is around 6-8 Go RAM, but you will get away with using 2-4 Go. Start the virtual machine with the Start green arrow. This may take a few minutes. If the virtual machine stops during startup, it is generally because you don't have enough resources. Try to open a process manager and kill some RAM-consuming processes, or lower the RAM needed by the virtual machine using the above step.
