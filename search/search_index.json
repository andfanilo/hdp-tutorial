Objectives Get used to the Ambari interface Upload data into HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System Run MapReduce jobs on data in HDFS Run Pig jobs on data in HDFS Run Hive jobs on data in HDFS 1. Browsing the Ambari interface Open a web browser to http://localhost:8888 to be greeted with the Hortonworks Data Platform dashboard. Click on Launch Dashboard in the left column to pop-up a new browser to Ambari. You can also go to http://localhost:8080 directly. Enter the credentials: raj_ops / raj_ops . You will arrive on the Ambari dashboard, your cockpit into the Hadoop platform. Browsing the Ambari dashboard In the left sidebar, you should recognize some of the Hadoop services presented in the lecture. The main area displays KPIs to monitor the platform. Apart from Supervisors Live, there should not have too many red flags. The topbar has a few links to running services, list of hosts and an admin portal. Some links go to http://sandbox.hortonworks.com , replace that by http://localhost if you want to check them out. Browse the dashboard to answer the following: Questions on the Ambari dashboard How many Namenodes/Datanodes are currently running in the virtual machine ? What is the jdbc URL to connect to the Hive server ? The YARN cluster comprises of a Resource Manager and a Node Manager. How do you restart all Node Managers ? 2. Uploading files to HDFS There are two ways to upload data to HDFS: from the Ambari Files View and from a terminal. In this section we will: Upload the data folder of the project (which you can find here ) into HDFS through the Ambari Files View Move folders, then upload the titanic.csv file in HDFS with the command line. Using the Ambari Files View Question Find the Ambari Files View. Create a new folder root inside /user . Change the permissions of the folder /user/root to add group and other write/execute permissions. This will prove necessary so the root user can actually access its own folder from the command-line. Enter the /user/root folder, create a new data folder and upload geolocation.csv and trucks.csv inside. You should have /user/root/data/geolocation.csv and user/root/data/trucks.csv by the end. We now have data in HDFS! geolocation.csv \u2013 This is the collected geolocation data from the trucks. It contains records showing truck location, date, time, type of event, speed, etc. trucks.csv \u2013 This is data was exported from a relational database and it shows information on truck models, driverid, truckid, and aggregated mileage info. But what does it mean? You have to imagine the Hadoop Data Platform is actually a remote cluster of machines, so when you upload a big file in HDFS it gets cut into blocks of 64MB and spread accross multiple DataNodes, and the NameNode keeps a reference for this file in HDFS to all blocks in the cluster. Info The URL /user/root/data/geolocation.csv in Ambari Views is actually hdfs:///user/root/data/geolocation.csv . The hdfs:/// specifies to look into the HDFS cluster instead of locally when using a HDFS client. hdfs:/// is a shortcut for hdfs://<host>:<port>/ so you won't need to specify hdfs://sandbox.hortonworks.com:8020/ every time. Recap : we have uploaded data into HDFS, in the /user/root folder. Using the Command-line In this section, we will use the command-line to check that HDFS indeed has our data files in /user/root , then we will upload the titanic.csv . Tip Don't be discouraged by the command-line. It is one of the best ways to interact with remote systems, enabling scripting and copy-pasting commands! I recommend taking advantage of this session to follow the Directly ssh into the machine section, and download and try PuTTY on Windows, or use the terminal on Mac/Linux, to connect to remote machines like this virtual machine. This experience is especially helpful in enterprise when you need to run commands on remote machines. Directly ssh into the machine On Windows, use an ssh client like PuTTy , then SSH into localhost on port 2222. Credentials are root / hadoop . You can also, especially on Mac/Linux machines, open a terminal and directly ssh into the virtual machine with ssh -p 2222 root@localhost . Using the integrated browser-based shell You can connect to a shell in the Virtual machine with your browser in http://localhost:4200. Credentials are root / hadoop . Note In both cases you will be asked to change your root password. Type the current password again then change to a long password. Just remember it for future sessions . Moving the data folder to geoloc Now that you are connected to your virtual machine: You can access the hdfs command from the terminal. This should output the help from the command line. Display the version of HDFS with hdfs version . Output ssh -p 2222 root@localhost Could not create directory '/home/.../.ssh'. The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2222 ([127.0.0.1]:2222)' can't be established.

Then hdfs dfs <command> -h gives you the command manual. List all folders inside HDFS with hdfs dfs -ls . The command hdfs dfs -ls will take you to hdfs:///user/root . hdfs uses your UNIX username to go to the HDFS home location. Since you're connected using root in the Virtual Machine, it connects by default to hdfs:///user/root . Rename the hdfs:///user/root/data folder to hdfs:///user/root/geoloc with hdfs dfs -mv . Remember by default that hdfs dfs -mv data geoloc is equivalent to hdfs dfs -mv hdfs:///user/root/data hdfs:///user/root/geoloc . Download the Titanic dataset into HDFS Use the wget command to download the Titanic dataset in the filesystem of your virtual machine. Verify the file is present with ls and correct with head -n 5 titanic.csv .

Build the /user/root/test HDFS folder with hdfs dfs mkdir <path_to_folder> . Copy titanic.csv file from the local VM into the /user/root/test HDFS folder. Changing permissions for hdfs:///tmp Currently, the hdfs:///tmp folder doesn't have permissions for everyone to write in. In the Hadoop ecosystem, root is not the superuser but hdfs is. So we need to be in the hdfs user before running set permissions. Run the following script. sudo su - su hdfs hdfs dfs -chmod -R 777 /tmp Don't forget to exit to go back to the root user. Recap In hdfs:///user/root/ , we have moved the contents of the data folder into geoloc We downloaded titanic.csv dataset into the virtual machine, then sent it to HDFS in hdfs:///user/root/test . We changed permissions for hdfs:///tmp .

Running a MapReduce job Time to compute stuff on data in HDFS. You should be using a command-line as the root user. Compute a distributed Pi Run the Pi example : yarn jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar pi 4 100 . You can check all your jobs in the Resource Manager UI , from Ambari. Question Make the Pi calculation a bit more precise. Looking at the help of the function below, what would be nMaps ? nSamples ? [ root@sandbox ~ ] yarn jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar pi Usage: org.apache.hadoop.examples.QuasiMonteCarlo <nMaps> <nSamples> Compute wordcount on files in HDFS Now we want to run a wordcount on a file inside HDFS, let's run it on files inside hdfs:///user/root/geoloc/ . Run yarn jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount geoloc/geolocation.csv output . The command will not work if hdfs:///user/root/output already exists, in that case remove the folder with hdfs dfs -rm -r -f output . Examine the hdfs:///user/root/output folder. You can use hdfs dfs -ls output and hdfs dfs -cat output/part-r-00000 . Question Can you explain the part-r-00000 ? Only one reducer is working there. You can edit the number of reducers running with the flag -D mapred.reduce.tasks=10 . Edit the previous command to change the number of reducers working and output this in a new folder output2 . Question Examine the output2 folder. Can you note a difference with the previous execution ? Do you want to know more about the Java MapReduce code in the JAR? I am not going to have you write Java code to compute MapReduce, but in case you are wondering: import java.io.IOException ; import java.util.* ; import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path ; import org.apache.hadoop.conf.* ; import org.apache.hadoop.io.* ; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.* ; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat ; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.TextInputFormat ; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat ; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.TextOutputFormat ; public class WordCount { public static class Map extends Mapper < LongWritable , Text , Text , IntWritable > { private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable ( 1 ); private Text word = new Text (); public void map ( LongWritable key , Text value , Context context ) throws IOException , InterruptedException { String line = value . toString (); StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer ( line ); while ( tokenizer . hasMoreTokens ()) { word . set ( tokenizer . nextToken ()); context . write ( word , one ); } } } public static class Reduce extends Reducer < Text , IntWritable , Text , IntWritable > { public void reduce ( Text key , Iterator < IntWritable > values , Context context ) throws IOException , InterruptedException { int sum = 0 ; while ( values . hasNext ()) { sum += values . next (). get (); } context . write ( key , new IntWritable ( sum )); } } public static void main ( String [] args ) throws Exception { Configuration conf = new Configuration (); Job job = new Job ( conf , \"wordcount\" ); job . setOutputKeyClass ( Text . class ); job . setOutputValueClass ( IntWritable . class ); job . setMapperClass ( Map . class ); job . setReducerClass ( Reduce . class ); job . setInputFormatClass ( TextInputFormat . class ); job . setOutputFormatClass ( TextOutputFormat . class ); FileInputFormat . addInputPath ( job , new Path ( args [ 0 ] )); FileOutputFormat . setOutputPath ( job , new Path ( args [ 1 ] )); job . waitForCompletion ( true ); } } 4. Running Pig jobs If you take a look at the Java code for Wordcount, as BI Analysts / Data Scientists you are probably not going to want to write those. In this section we look into Pig, a higher-level tool which converts Pig Latin scripts into MapReduce scripts. There are two ways to start a Pig session here: Interactively through the Terminal/Command-line, by launching a Pig shell with pig and running commands one by one. There's a dedicated Pig View in Ambari. This should be the preferred method if you want to run full scripts but is much longer to run than the Pig shell. Sometimes it errors with an exception from Jetty, don't hesitate to close and come back to the View to reinitialize. For this section, we focus on using Pig to analyze the geolocation dataset. Run the following script/commands to load the file into a variable, then display the first ten lines from the geolocation file: geoloc = LOAD '/user/root/geoloc/geolocation.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (truckid,driverid,event,latitude,longitude,city,state,velocity,event_ind,idling_ind); geoloc_limit = LIMIT geoloc 10; DUMP geoloc_limit; Let's try to compute some stats on this file. geoloc = LOAD '/user/root/geoloc/geolocation.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (truckid:chararray, driverid:chararray, event:chararray, latitude:double, longitude:double, city:chararray, state:chararray, velocity:double, event_ind:long, idling_ind:long); truck_ids = GROUP geoloc BY truckid; result = FOREACH truck_ids GENERATE group AS truckid, COUNT(geoloc) as count; STORE result INTO '/tmp/results'; DUMP result; Question Check the hdfs:///tmp/results folder stored in HDFS by the STORE line. What can you say compared to the MapReduce wordcount ? Count the list of distinct cities visited per truckid Compute the mean velocity per truckid You may still find legacy Pig jobs in the nature, but you should not be required to write new Pig scripts anymore. 5. Running SQL jobs with Hive We as analysts are much more used to using SQL to process our data. The role of datawarehouse package in the Hadoop ecosystem goes to Hive. Note In today's world, SQL skills are still very important and one of the primary languages to manipulate data. So always work on your SQL. Like for Pig: you can start a Hive shell from your terminal/command-line, with the hive command. This is dedicated to simple SQL queries or operational management. There's a dedicated Hive View in Ambari, with some visualization capabilities. Time to create a table to analyze the geolocations again! Move the trucks.csv file outside of the hdfs:///user/root/geoloc folder to hdfs:///user/root/trucks . Create an external table for the hdfs:///user/root/geoloc folder which contains geolocation.csv . CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE geolocation ( truckid STRING , driverid STRING , event STRING , latitude DOUBLE , longitude DOUBLE , city STRING , state STRING , velocity DOUBLE , event_ind BIGINT , idling_ind BIGINT ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LOCATION '/user/root/geoloc' ; Visualize the first rows of the table SELECT truckid FROM geolocation LIMIT 10 ; Note The way Hive works is every file inside the geoloc folder is read by Hive as data in the table. This is why we had to move out the trucks.csv file. The following command creates a Hive table pointing to a HDFS location. You can drop it, it won't destroy the data in HDFS Question Are you again able to count the list of distinct cities visited per truckid, and mean velocity per truckid ? On the Ambari View, count the number of distinct cities per trucks and display it on a bar chart. Conclusion We have seen the first Hadoop libraries, and we are now able to store raw data in HDFS, then process it with Pig or Hive. Going back to our objectives Get used to the Ambari interface Upload data into HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System Run MapReduce jobs on data in HDFS Run Pig jobs on data in HDFS Run Hive jobs on data in HDFS In the next tutorial, we will build our own ETL-like solution in Big Data.

Then hdfs dfs <command> -h gives you the command manual. List all folders inside HDFS with hdfs dfs -ls . The command hdfs dfs -ls will take you to hdfs:///user/root . hdfs uses your UNIX username to go to the HDFS home location. Since you're connected using root in the Virtual Machine, it connects by default to hdfs:///user/root . Rename the hdfs:///user/root/data folder to hdfs:///user/root/geoloc with hdfs dfs -mv . Remember by default that hdfs dfs -mv data geoloc is equivalent to hdfs dfs -mv hdfs:///user/root/data hdfs:///user/root/geoloc . Download the Titanic dataset into HDFS Use the wget command to download the Titanic dataset in the filesystem of your virtual machine. Verify the file is present with ls and correct with head -n 5 titanic.csv .

Build the /user/root/test HDFS folder with hdfs dfs mkdir <path_to_folder> . Copy titanic.csv file from the local VM into the /user/root/test HDFS folder. Changing permissions for hdfs:///tmp Currently, the hdfs:///tmp folder doesn't have permissions for everyone to write in. In the Hadoop ecosystem, root is not the superuser but hdfs is. So we need to be in the hdfs user before running set permissions. Run the following script. sudo su - su hdfs hdfs dfs -chmod -R 777 /tmp Don't forget to exit to go back to the root user. Recap In hdfs:///user/root/ , we have moved the contents of the data folder into geoloc We downloaded titanic.csv dataset into the virtual machine, then sent it to HDFS in hdfs:///user/root/test . We changed permissions for hdfs:///tmp .

In this section we look into Pig, a higher-level tool which converts Pig Latin scripts into MapReduce scripts. There are two ways to start a Pig session here: Interactively through the Terminal/Command-line, by launching a Pig shell with pig and running commands one by one. There's a dedicated Pig View in Ambari. This should be the preferred method if you want to run full scripts but is much longer to run than the Pig shell. Sometimes it errors with an exception from Jetty, don't hesitate to close and come back to the View to reinitialize. For this section, we focus on using Pig to analyze the geolocation dataset. Run the following script/commands to load the file into a variable, then display the first ten lines from the geolocation file: geoloc = LOAD '/user/root/geoloc/geolocation.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (truckid,driverid,event,latitude,longitude,city,state,velocity,event_ind,idling_ind); geoloc_limit = LIMIT geoloc 10; DUMP geoloc_limit; Let's try to compute some stats on this file. geoloc = LOAD '/user/root/geoloc/geolocation.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (truckid:chararray, driverid:chararray, event:chararray, latitude:double, longitude:double, city:chararray, state:chararray, velocity:double, event_ind:long, idling_ind:long); truck_ids = GROUP geoloc BY truckid; result = FOREACH truck_ids GENERATE group AS truckid, COUNT(geoloc) as count; STORE result INTO '/tmp/results'; DUMP result; Question Check the hdfs:///tmp/results folder stored in HDFS by the STORE line. What can you say compared to the MapReduce wordcount ? Count the list of distinct cities visited per truckid Compute the mean velocity per truckid You may still find legacy Pig jobs in the nature, but you should not be required to write new Pig scripts anymore.","title":"4. Running Pig jobs"},{"location":"td1/#5-running-sql-jobs-with-hive","text":"We as analysts are much more used to using SQL to process our data. The role of datawarehouse package in the Hadoop ecosystem goes to Hive. Note In today's world, SQL skills are still very important and one of the primary languages to manipulate data. So always work on your SQL. Like for Pig: you can start a Hive shell from your terminal/command-line, with the hive command. This is dedicated to simple SQL queries or operational management. There's a dedicated Hive View in Ambari, with some visualization capabilities. Time to create a table to analyze the geolocations again! Move the trucks.csv file outside of the hdfs:///user/root/geoloc folder to hdfs:///user/root/trucks . Create an external table for the hdfs:///user/root/geoloc folder which contains geolocation.csv . CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE geolocation ( truckid STRING , driverid STRING , event STRING , latitude DOUBLE , longitude DOUBLE , city STRING , state STRING , velocity DOUBLE , event_ind BIGINT , idling_ind BIGINT ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LOCATION '/user/root/geoloc' ; Visualize the first rows of the table SELECT truckid FROM geolocation LIMIT 10 ; Note The way Hive works is every file inside the geoloc folder is read by Hive as data in the table. This is why we had to move out the trucks.csv file. The following command creates a Hive table pointing to a HDFS location. You can drop it, it won't destroy the data in HDFS Question Are you again able to count the list of distinct cities visited per truckid, and mean velocity per truckid ?
